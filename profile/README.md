The Einstein Telescopehttp is an advanced gravitational-wave observatory, currently in the planning stage. 

Gravitational waves contain information about the most extreme events in the universe, from the nature of black holes and neutron stars to the first moments after the Big Bang. Thanks to these waves, we can study the cosmos as never before.
